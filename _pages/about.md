<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Zhengxiao Yan (could be pronounced like John-Shawn Yan😝), received Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.fsu.edu" target="_blank">Florida State University</a>'s FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, specializing in Civil Engineering, working with <a href="https://eng.famu.fsu.edu/cee/people/alamdari">Dr. Nasrin Alamdari</a>. My academic journey began with a B.S. in Environmental Science from <a href="https://www.hhu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Hohai University</a>, an M.E. in Environmental Engineering from <a href="https://www.nwu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Northwest University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.whu.edu.cn/info/1183/4854.htm">Dr. Jun Xia</a> and <a href="https://env.nwu.edu.cn/info/1134/1092.htm">Dr. Jinxi Song</a>, and an exchange program in Civil Engineering at the <a href="https://www.unm.edu/" target="_blank">University of New Mexico</a>, where I spent part of my time working with <a href="https://civil.unm.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/ricardo-gonzalez-pinzon.html">Dr. Ricardo Gonzalez-Pinzon</a>. My passion for environmental science and engineering has driven me to explore various aspects of geosciences.

My research interests lie at the intersection of *machine learning*, *climate change*, *ecological modeling*, *carbon flux, storage, and sequestration*, *environmental health*, *hydrology and geographical modeling*, *remote sensing*, and *water & food resources and security*. I am currently focused on modeling terrestrial ecosystem carbon fluxes between land and the atmosphere and carbon storage in the agricultural landscape in the USA, working with <a href="https://www.cpc.unc.edu/people/fellows/conghe-song/">Dr. Conghe Song</a> at <a href="https://www.unc.edu/" target="_blank">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>. Generally, my work often involves using advanced algorithms/modeling and multi-source data to develop process-based or ML-based models for environmental decision-making and policy development. I have published several papers in the top journals in my research fields <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_nVCKVMAAAAJ">
