<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Zhengxiao Yan, a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.fsu.edu" target="_blank">Florida State University</a>'s FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, specializing in Civil Engineering. My academic journey began with a B.S. in Environmental Science from <a href="https://www.hhu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Hohai University</a>, an M.E. in Environmental Engineering from <a href="https://www.nwu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Northwest University</a>, and an exchange program in Civil Engineering at the <a href="https://www.unm.edu/" target="_blank">University of New Mexico</a>. My passion for environmental science and engineering has driven me to explore various aspects of geosciences.

My research interests lie at the intersection of *machine learning*, *climate change*, *environmental health*, *hydrology and geographical modeling*, *remote sensing*, and *water & food resources and security*. I am currently focused on predicting and mitigating harmful algal blooms and understanding the impacts of climate change on various environmental factors. My work often involves using advanced numerical algorithms and multi-sources data to develop predictive models for environmental decision-making and policy development. I have published several papers in the top journals in my research fields <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_nVCKVMAAAAJ">
